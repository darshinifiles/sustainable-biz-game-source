# Notes From Our Team

Our project is contained within the src folder of this repository
 * Excluding the node modules folder, everything has been included
 
This repository contains code for our project 'The Sustainable Biz Game' created as part of the Digital Investigation module for the MSc Computational and Data Journalism course at Cardiff University.

Our game was built with react.js. Individual game 'screens' are stored within an object in 'components.js'. These are called upon by the core component in 'index.js' as players progress throughout the game. 'Article.js' contains the article that accompanies our game. The graphics were designed by our team and are included within the images folder of this project. The game storylines were written by our team and were based on interviews we conducted with small businesses around the country. These storylines are included in "storylines.js".



### Project Outline:
‘The Sustainable Biz Game’ project was created for environmentally conscious consumers to learn more about the challenges facing environmentally sustainable small businesses in the UK. The project centred around the development of an online role-playing game in which users take control of building a small restaurant business. To win, users must complete the game with enough money and sustainability points (awarded for ‘green’ decision making) to pass thresholds for both of these variables. This is accompanied by an article that uses information we gathered from interviews with small businesses, researchers and representative bodies to underline the game’s portrayal of the challenges faced by these businesses.
